## C++ Language

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository contains fundamental C++ programs categorized into three folders:
- **Basic**: Contains foundational programs such as calculating the area of a circle, using Boolean data types, moving to the next line, calculating percentages for all subjects, printing numbers, finding the remainder without using modulo, and computing simple interest.
- **If Else**: Programs implementing conditional logic such as checking divisibility by 5 and 3, divisibility by 5 and 3 but not 15, even or odd numbers, absolute value calculation, profit and loss, checking if a number is three-digit or not, a grading system based on marks, and determining if a character is an alphabet.
- **Take Input**: Programs demonstrating user input handling, such as obtaining ASCII values, taking input from users, calculating the fractional part of a number, finding the area of a circle using user input, summing given numbers, and computing simple interest.

## This repository contains fundamental C++ programs for practice. It covers basic concepts of C++ programming, including input handling, conditional statements, and mathematical operations.
